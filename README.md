# 🏦 Bank Marketing Data Analysis
### 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer responses to a bank's marketing campaigns. The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features such as age, job, marital status, and previous interactions.

### 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used
#### Python Libraries:     
Pandas     
NumPy     
Seaborn     
Matplotlib     
Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)     
Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GridSearchCV, etc.)     
Data Preprocessing: Standardization and handling imbalanced datasets using SMOTE.     
Model Evaluation: Accuracy Score, Precision Score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
